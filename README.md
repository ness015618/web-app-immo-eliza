# Real Estate Price Prediction Deployment Project

This is the last step of the Immo Eliza project, which aimed to introduce us to
data analysis and data engineering. The different steps were the following :

1. Web Scraping to gather data
2. Data analysis and visualization
3. Regression
4. Deployment

The data and model used in this project are the result of the previous steps.

## Deployment

The web app was created and deployed using Streamlit, and can be accessed from :

## In progress

The prediction for sale prices are satisfying but the predictions for renting need strong improvement.

## Timeline

This project took 2 days for completion and was done as part of the AI Bootcamp at Becode.org.
